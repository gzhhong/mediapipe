## Installation
python3.9 and venv
pip install tensorflow keras six tflite_support

## prepare training data
In the training folder there are 4 pictures, the pictures and txt ended with "_mr" is the data for left hand, which are "mirror" from the right hand, each pictures has landmarks txt file contains 21 points x, y, z coordinates.

The training_data.tfrecord is generated by tfrecord.py. It can be verified by verify_tfrecord.py.

## training the keras and h5 model
The train_mediapipe.py is the training code, it will generate the hand_landmark_model.h5 and hand_landmark_model.keras.

There are only 25 epochs and will take less than 1 minutes

## convert tflite
The hand_landmark_model_float16.tflite is converted from hand_landmark_model.keras by convert_to_tflite.py.

## test
You can then test the tflite model and keras model by test_model.py. There will be two images presenting the keras model and tflite model results. You can see the keras model can give z axis more accurate ( it can give negative value) but the tflite model always give positive value, when more training data added, the output of z-axis of tflite model will close to zero, but never be negative.

## Issue
The tflite model can not give negative value for z-axis, it always give positive value, even when more training data added.
